## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various features relevant to hotel pricing, such as:

- Hotel location
- Star rating
- Number of rooms
- Amenities offered
- Customer reviews
- Seasonality factors

These features are used to train the predictive model to estimate hotel prices accurately.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kishankumar1328/Hotel-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Hotel-Price-Prediction
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

The `main.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open `main.ipynb`** and follow the instructions within the notebook.

### Running the Python Script

The `main.py` script allows you to run predictions on the dataset.

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure that the dataset files are in the same directory as the script.

## 📈 Model

The predictive model is built using IBM SPSS Modeler and is saved in the `Hotel Price Prediction SPSS Modeler.str` file. This model can be opened and modified using IBM SPSS Modeler for further analysis or deployment.
